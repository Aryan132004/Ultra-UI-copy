# 💻 UltraEdit-style Download Page – Mini Project

A fully responsive and modern download page inspired by [UltraEdit](https://www.ultraedit.com/downloads/ultraedit-download-thank-you/?utm_source=CWH&utm_medium=LeadsAcquisition&utm_content=UEDownload&utm_campaign=UETrialDownload), built using **only HTML & CSS**.
